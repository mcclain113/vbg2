; Upon entering the windows+b hotkey, this script gets a range of cells in column A through (pick your number). 
; It will copy and paste the contents of each cell and tab over. After the last cell in the column, it will go to the next row and do
; the samething until there are no more cells (i.e. a blank cell). NOTE, the script starts at A2, so it assumes you have a header.

; Usage:
; Press windows button+b to activate.
